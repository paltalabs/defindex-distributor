# Yieldblox Incident.
Table was divided in two: `defindex_distributor_yieldblox_incident_input_group_0` and
`defindex_distributor_yieldblox_incident_input_group_1`

As of Feb 27th 2026, 19h00 UTC we have only distributed to group 0.
Today we only distributed to Group 0.

Group 0 are all vaults that have taken out their exposure to YieldBlox (1155 out of 1194 addresses), with 99,99% of the value to be distributed.

Group 1 are vaults that still are exposed to YieldBlox, and include a lot of tests vaults, with a total value of 13 USDC  to be distributed and 39 recipients. Distribution to these vaults would have failed.

We are contacting teams that have created these vaults. If until March 06 they havent unwind their yieldblox position, we will send funds to the end users.
